Their meet-cute was also a meet-political. In 1981, Jane O’Meara Driscoll, a recently divorced transplanted New Yorker, went to a meeting where the then mayor of Burlington was discussing a proposed tax hike that many thought would hurt low-income residents. Jane took the floor to ask some pointed questions, and when she sat down the person next to her said, “You sound like Bernie Sanders.”Meet Jane Sanders, Bernie’s closest advisor

Candidates from the back of the GOP pack try to explain why they haven’t given up

 After the first Republican debate on Wednesday evening, four candidates were asked to explain themselves. Former New York Gov. George Pataki, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal all participated in a debate for those candidates who are polling behind the main GOP field. Following their debate, which was held three hours prior to the main event, the quartet talked to reporters in the spin room where they faced questions about why they’re still running and whether they have a real chance to win.
