Lions finally get Ford tough and offer glimmer of hope for NFL laughingstock

Ninety years old and apparently out of patience in the face of pitiful that has defined the NFL franchise she now owns, Martha Firestone Ford dropped the hammer Thursday on the Detroit Lions .¬†
General manager Martin Mayhew is gone. Team president Tom Lewand is gone. More is expected to come. Scouts. Executives. Whomever. Coach Jim Caldwell is safe for now, although he'll likely be fired at season's end. The Lions are 1-7 and on their bye week.
Martha assumed power when her husband William Clay Ford died last year. She is not interested in being a figurehead. This is an activist move. Moreover, daughter Shelia Ford Hamp is, according to the Detroit Free Press, now assuming a "prominent role" with the team.¬†

"We are very disappointed with the results of the season thus far and believe a change in leadership was needed," Martha Firestone Ford said Thursday.
So a woman's touch is proving to be an iron fist.
It's not unusual for one-win teams to get a bloodletting. It's unusual, however, for a franchise to manage just a single playoff victory since 1957 ‚Äì going on six decades of near complete futility.
That's Detroit though and that's why this was such a significant day. Fans took to talk radio and social media to debate where this ranked among great days in the team history. Top 10, top five, top two (behind either that lone playoff victory in 1991 or the firing of Matt Millen in 2008)?
[Yahoo Daily Fantasy Football: First place wins $100K in our $500K contest for Week 9 ]
This signifies the possibility of a new day in Detroit. There is no guarantee of success. Everyone knows that. The replacements of Mayhew, Lewand and others is the key going forward.
"As of today we are beginning a national search for the best leadership going forward," Ford said. "Our fans deserve a winning football team and we will do everything possible to make it a reality."
At least there is a forward. William Clay Ford Sr., who bought the team in 1963, was known as an agreeable owner and beloved boss. His tendency was to hire good people, likable people and give them ample, or way too ample, time and freedom to do their job. He was painfully loyal and never meddlesome in a sport that thrives on cutthroat competitiveness. Since 1967, the Lions have had four general managers. Four. This might make sense if they were ringing up championships, if you were say Green Bay or someplace (which, for instance, has had 10 different "general managers" during that time frame). The opposite was true of course.

It is even more absurd that Russ Thomas was the GM from 1967-1988. He delivered just six winning seasons in 20 and, of course, zero postseason victories. That's a disaster in most places but when he was replaced, he was replaced by his prot√©g√©, Chuck Schmidt, who drafted Barry Sanders  but couldn't maximize it. He was done in 2000.
The Lions then went outside the box and bought whatever broadcaster Matt Millen was selling, making perhaps the worst front-office hires in NFL history. That was only half of it though. They allowed Millen to live in Pennsylvania and "commute" to work and then, even as the losing seasons piled up ‚Äì Millen's teams never had a winning record ‚Äì Millen kept getting another season to get things right. There was no stomach for a firing.
Once fan unrest was so great ‚Äì they staged a "Millen Man March" ‚Äì and the franchise barreled to a historic 0-16 season, Millen was finally canned.
And then they inexplicably replaced him with his assistant, Mayhew. He is universally hailed as a nice guy but his candidacy was based on the idea that under Millen he'd seen what not to do and thus would do the opposite.

That may sound like the plot of a Chris Farley movie, but it was a gut punch reality for Lions fans.
Consider a year ago, when endless top-five draft picks produced an 11-5 team. Mayhew and Lewand misread the pending free agency of Ndamukong Suh  and Nick Fairley . Rather than plan ahead and use the No. 10 pick in the 2014 draft to land a replacement defensive lineman (St. Louis got star Aaron Donald  at No. 13) they gambled on a project tight end in Eric Ebron , who hasn't panned out.
Now the Lions are their typical disaster, not getting better and not even trading away one of their marketable assets for future picks before the deadline ‚Äì Calvin Johnson , Golden Tate , etc.
So what Martha Firestone Ford did on Thursday was at least ‚Ä¶ something. It was at least a sign of concern from ‚Ä¶ someone. It was at least a lashing out at unacceptability from ‚Ä¶ anyone.
There is no reason that one franchise should be so fruitless, pointless, disheartening for this long. Most fans have complained it was about William Clay Ford's lack of urgency and overabundance of faith. Now he's gone, and with his wife and daughter in place, the women demand better. The obvious game plan here is simple: pay big and lure in a top-line football mind who will be given total control.
The hard part is finding the right person, but if they can, then Detroit at least has a chance.
Going on six decades of so many lost seasons, that's all the fans want at this point. A 90-year-old woman at least gave them that, at least gave them a long overdue house cleaning and the potential fresh start they rightfully doubted would ever come.
