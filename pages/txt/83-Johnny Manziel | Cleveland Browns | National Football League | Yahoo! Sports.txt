Rotoworld 



                Johnny Manziel completed 15-of-33 passes for 168 yards with one touchdown and rushed four times for 31 yards in the Browns' Week 9 loss to the Bengals.
                
Thu, Nov 5
Rotoworld 



                Johnny Manziel will start Thursday night's Week 9 game against the Bengals.
                
Wed, Nov 4
Rotoworld 



                With starting quarterback Josh McCown unable to play because of a painful rib injury, Manziel will start Thursday night's game against the Cincinnati Bengals,
                
Wed, Nov 4
Stats Inc. 



                Browns starting quarterback Josh McCown's ribs remain sore and it's possible he'll have to sit out Thursday's game in Cincinnati. The 36-year-old fought through the pain before he was replaced late in the fourth quarter by Johnny Manziel, who may have to start against the undefeated Bengals.  
                
Tue, Nov 3
Stats Inc. 



                NFL.com's Rand Getlin reports the Browns expect Josh McCown (ribs) to miss Thursday's game against the Bengals, and will start Johnny Manziel.
                
Tue, Nov 3
Rotoworld 



                Browns starting quarterback Josh McCown says he felt better throwing in practice but remains questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. If McCown can't play, Manziel will make his second start this season. Coach Mike Pettine says he might not decide on his starter until game time.    
                
Fri, Oct 30
Stats Inc. 



                Johnny Manziel was interviewed by league officials regarding an October 12 domestic incident Wednesday night.
