Miami Dolphins wide receiver DeVante Parker missed practice on Thursday because of a setback with his surgically repaired foot,¬†according to beat writer Adam Beasley.  Parker left last week's game against the New England Patriots before a pass was even thrown his way.
Fantasy impact: Parker was added and dropped often in deeper fantasy leagues early in the season based on his potential, but odds are he's not on any fantasy rosters at the moment. It seems unlikely that he will play in this week's game against the Buffalo Bills.





He was never a focal point of the team's offense, especially as Jarvis Landry and Lamar Miller grew in their roles this season. Parker is more a talent worth stashing for future years, not an immediate impact player you can use right now.
Fantasy owners shouldn't expect Parker to play this week and even if he does, owners who insert him into the starting lineup or even just put him on the roster will need a crystal ball to predict the future.
