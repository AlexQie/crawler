The University of Missouri canceled all football activities on Sunday, hours after coach Gary Pinkel tweeted out support of his players , who refused to practice or play until school president Tim Wolfe is "no longer in office."
The issue centers on what some Missouri students believe is a slow and inconsequential response to some racially motivated incidents on the Columbia campus. 
Wolfe announced his resignation on Monday morning.
