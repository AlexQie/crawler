Memphis Grizzlies forward Matt Barnes and New York Knicks coach Derek Fisher have some personal history. That personal history became very public information last month when¬†reports swirled  about Barnes driving to his estranged wife's home to confront him over a relationship with Fisher.
Fans in opposing NBA arenas have¬†not let Barnes forget about the incident  this season, greeting him with chants of Fisher's name. Barnes spoke about the incident on Monday and blamed Fisher and the press for turning the story into a widespread knowledge.
