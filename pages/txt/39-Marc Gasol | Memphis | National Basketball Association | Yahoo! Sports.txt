‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  Player Notes

                Marc Gasol played through a strained neck on Thursday during a 115-96 loss to the Blazers, scoring 15 points with five rebounds, three assists and two blocks.
                
11 hours ago
Rotoworld 



                Marc Gasol (strained neck) will be a game-time decision for Thursday's matchup with the Trail Blazers.
                
Thu, Nov 5
Rotoworld 



                Marc Gasol (neck) will warm up to see if he's well enough to play on Thursday.
                
Thu, Nov 5
Rotoworld 



                Marc Gasol (neck) said he feels "great" and remains a game-time decision.
                
Thu, Nov 5
Rotoworld 



                Marc Gasol (neck) will start on Thursday against the Blazers.
                
Thu, Nov 5
Rotoworld 



                Marc Gasol (strained neck) is questionable to play vs. the Blazers on Thursday.
                
Wed, Nov 4
Rotoworld 



                Updating a previous report, Marc Gasol (neck spasms) will not return to Tuesday's game vs. the Kings.
                
Tue, Nov 3
Rotoworld 



                The Grizzlies got destroyed by the Warriors on Monday and lost by 50 points, so all of their fantasy-relevant players took a hit in the box score.
                
Mon, Nov 2
Rotoworld 



                Marc Gasol is dealing with neck spasms and will be able to keep playing against the Kings on Tuesday.
                
Tue, Nov 3
Rotoworld 



                Gasol had 20 points to help Memphis win at Indiana on Thursday.
